I'm a passionate software developer with an analytical problem solving skill who 
profers solutions in code. I have a background in Economics. This gives an incredible 
insight to solving problems relating to the financial industry. I am proficient in frontend and
backend technologies like React, Django, Flask and Fast API. With this, I know you might call 
a **Pythonista** or a **JavaScript Enthusiast**. Well, that's me! :v:
