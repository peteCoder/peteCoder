I'm a passionate software developer with analytical problem solving skills who 
profers solutions in code. I have a background in Economics. This gives me an incredible 
insight to solving problems relating to the financial industry. I am proficient in frontend and
backend technologies like React, Django, Flask and Fast API. With this, I know you might call me 
a **Pythonista** or a **JavaScript Enthusiast**. Well, that's me! :v:


I'm not just a programmer. I am a team player.
I am also seeking for opportunities to work in software development teams and to also callaborate.
